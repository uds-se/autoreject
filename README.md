## Frequently Answered Questions

### Is this for real?

Autoreject is an April's Fools joke.  No reviewer with a clear mind would ever use such a tool, right?  Choose from options and enjoy!


### Where do these text snippets come from?

The "arguments" in the generator are all inspired by real reviews and arguments I have collected over time.  This includes reviews colleagues and I have gotten for our papers, co-reviews of papers I reviewed, and discussions in PC meetings.  I also follow [ShitMyReviewersSay](https://twitter.com/YourPaperSucks) for inspiration.


### Why a site like this?

With this site, I hope to raise some attention towards the problem of overly formalistic reviews - that is, "reviews" that take only a very shallow, "syntactical" look into a paper without considering its potential and deeper implications.  Plus, it is a rhetorical exercise - namely, how to turn any argument into rejection.


### Do such formalistic reviews actually exist?

Of course!  As a reviewer, you can make your life easier by pointing out one of the "issues" in the autoreject reviews.  Ignore the work's potential; ignore whether it may make some difference.  Avoid making a difficult decision and go for the first flaw you can find.


### Are reviews really this bad?

No.  While some reviews may be problematic, most reviewers are driven by the honest desire to understand and value the submitted material.  If a reviewer rejects your paper for whatever arguments, you should always ask yourself what you could and should have done to improve.  A "shallow" review often indicates that the reviewer was not motivated enough to get deeper, possibly because s/he had a bad day, but more likely because your paper could have done better.  Improve and try again.


### The form does not fit my branch of science.

I am active in the Software Engineering community, so the site is geared towards arguments, methods, and reviews in that community.  I'll happily include variants specialized for your community - e.g., for medicine or history.


### What are all the possible outcomes?

Feel free to experiment with the site.  If you want to cheat, examine the [source code](https://github.com/uds-se/autoreject/blob/master/index.html); this is where you can find all the snippets and their conditions.


### Is there a way to get your paper accepted?

Yes.  Two, to be precise.
